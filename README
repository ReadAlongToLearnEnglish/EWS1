Although i created the presentation and added the words, i would like to also attribute the image files were downloaded from :-
https://www.svgrepo.com/collection/emojione-emojis/

and they were made available under the MIT licence which is why i have decided to release the presentation under this license. 

The presentation file can be opened with a program called kwordquiz, an open source program to create and view flashcards by KDE.
